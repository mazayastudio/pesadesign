heading: 'Professional Experience in Greenfield and Brownfield Projects'
contents: 
  - 'I bring expertise in both greenfield and brownfield projects, with hands-on experience across diverse and challenging environments.'
  - 'I began my career in Romania, contributing to the design of transmission towers for complex terrains in Jordan and Abu Dhabi, as part of a team under the guidance of ELECTROMONTAJ SA. My key responsibility was the design of a new tower, focusing on optimizing its weight while ensuring structural integrity, using advanced modeling tools and techniques.'
  - 'In the Netherlands, I expanded my experience by working on brownfield projects with the DNV Energy Design Team. My role involved modeling existing towers and recalculating them to accommodate new load requirements arising from conductor replacements.'
  - 'My experience equips me to handle even the most complex transmission tower geometries, as demonstrated in the projects highlighted below.'
